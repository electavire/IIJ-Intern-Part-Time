Quick Start Guide:
https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

When downloading the release, the download should be checked using
the sha1sum linux commnand, and then verified at:
https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html
(Theres an input box for the return value of sha1sum)
For security reasons and whatnot.

IMPORTATNT NOTE!!!
When doing the initial zookeeper startup with
> bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
It wont terminate, ending with:
[2018-10-30 15:09:05,356] INFO binding to port 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181 (org.apache.zookeeper.server.NIOServerCnxnFactory)
and not giving the user command back.  It now just acts
as a log for zookeeper so open a new terminal to start kafka.


After using:
> bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Its the same idea with zookeeper, this terminal now acts
as a log for kafka.  To give Kafka any commands, we need
one more terminal.


Also going to want to install the python kafka client,
can be done easily with:

pip install kafka-python

For Testing Purposes, console consumers and producers can be used.

To creat a console consumer:
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
(Topic name should be changed accordingly)

To create a console producer:
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test
(Again, topic name should be changed according to needs)


Stop Command:
bin/kafka-server-stop.sh config/server.properties

Questions to be asked:
How is the data currently being used?

Is each program using the data on a seperate machine? or all on one?(Need to know for kafka partitioning, connecting each other)

CURRENTLY trying to continuously produce data to the kafka broker
Was able to upload one batch from ATLAS, but doing so continuously caused problems. Didnt figure out sleep yet tough. 
Hoping that solves problems.
